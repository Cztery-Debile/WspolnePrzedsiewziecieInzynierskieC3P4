**bstreamer** is a collection of tools intended to help load testing video streaming applications.


## bserver
Is an ip camera emulator. It can stream h264 video files stored in matroska format and live-generated pictures. It is capable to serve 10k connections with up to 40 gbps total bandwidth.


Videofiles must be placed to the ```video``` application directory. You can find some nice sample files on this website: http://jell.yfish.us/ 

#### Usage:
Install software and start server:
```
$ bserver -c server.yaml

time      | client connections | errors       | throughput 
=========================================================
16:13:00  | 4000 [+0; -0]      | 0            | 17.6 GiB   
```

Now server is ready to stream video.  

```shell script
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp  rtsp://localhost:8554/picture
```

When new client is connected you'll see ```+1``` here, in connections column:
```
time      | client connections | errors       | throughput 
=========================================================
16:14:00  | 1 [+1; -0]         | 0            | 1.6 MB
            |   |   |
            |   |   +-- lost connections during the past second
            |   +------ new connections during the past second            
            +---------- total connections   
```

Value in a column ```errors``` increments when server is unable to send data chunk just in time. It happens when network is not fast enough to process huge traffic amount.


##### Settings:

| ---|----|----|

Any streaming source configuration parameter can be overridden by URI parameter, like this:

| URL                                                                | Description                                                      |

| rtsp://localhost:8554/file?file=simpsons.mkv                       | streaming specific file ```video_samples\simpsons.mkv```                   |
